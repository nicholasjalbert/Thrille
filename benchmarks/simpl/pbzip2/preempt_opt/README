All the pbzip2 traces are optimal with 1 preempt.

for the segfaults, thread 0 must set the mutex to null to cause it to happen,
    but if it is not preempted the program will terminate so you need
    atleast one preempt.


for the destroyoing a locked mutex, some thread would have to block with it locked
    to make it 0 preempts, but that can't happen when compressing, so you need to 
    have atleast one preempt (and 3 ctxt switches).
