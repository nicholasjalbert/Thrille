-1) Branch Log
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The current Thrille branches include:

-master (standard trace format which should work with simplification tools
described in FSE10)

-simple (modifying the trace format for CS264 class project. This *will* break
simplification tools).

**YOU ARE CURRENTLY ON THE SIMPLE BRANCH**


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0) Preamble 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thrille was developed and tested on a SuSe 10.1 machine.  All seemed well in
preliminary testing on an Ubuntu VM.  Thrille is unlikely to work on Mac
without a substantial overhaul.

Standard free software boilerplate: there are no warranties or guarantees of
ANY kind.

All benchmarks belong to their respective owners.  If you are the creator
and/or rights holder of one of the benchmarks and would like it taken down,
please contact jalbert@eecs.berkeley.edu.  All bugs were hand inserted (except
for pbzip2 and swarm, both of which were old versions).

Send comments, questions, and suggestions to jalbert@eecs.berkeley.edu.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Basic Setup 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Thrille expects the environment variable $THRILLE_ROOT to be defined, if I
unzipped the tarball in my home directory, I would execute (or put into my
.bashrc) the following command: 

export THRILLE_ROOT=~/Thrille

2) You should also let the linker know to look in the Thrille binary directory
by executing (or putting in your .bashrc) the following command: 

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$THRILLE_ROOT/bin/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

3) You should now be able to compile the Thrillers relevant to trace
simplification.  Run the $THRILLE_ROOT/scripts/simpl/compile.sh script.

3) LLVM is required to track memory accesses performed by a program.  There are
three parts to setting up LLVM for Thrille:

        a) Getting the LLVM front-end binaries:  Thrille requires the LLVM 2.6
        front-end binaries (e.g. llvm-gcc, llvm-g++) to be on your path
        (binaries for most common architectures are available at
        http://llvm.org/releases/download.html).  For example, I might download
        the LLVM-GCC 4.2 Front End Binaries for Linux/x86_64 and unzip it in my
        home directory (/home/nick).  I then would add the binary directory to
        my path (and potentially my .bashrc so it will always be in my path):
        "export PATH=$PATH:/home/nick/llvm-gcc-4.2-2.6-x86_64-linux/bin".

        b) Now, once the binaries are in your path, you can run the script
        $THRILLE_ROOT/scripts/setupLLVM.sh to do the rest of the install.

        c) With this complete you can try out compiling a benchmark with LLVM.
        For example, try running make in $THRILLE_ROOT/benchmarks/simpl/bbuf/.
        If the compile completes with no complaints about LLVM, you have set it
        up correctly!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Architecture Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thrille uses dynamic library interposition to wrap all Pthread function calls.
Each wrapper has a default implementation which does nothing but call the
original pthread function.  Thrille provides handles for each function which
allows more interesting instrumentation to be done at these calls (e.g. you can
do processing BeforeMutexLock or AfterMutexLock).  When writing a Thriller, you
can selecctively override these wrapper methods to implement your program
analysis (e.g. tracking each thread's lockset by overriding the
BeforeMutexLock and AfterMutexUnlock method).

LLVM comes into the picture because we want to be able to track the program's
use of memory, but we can't interpose on read and write operations.  Instead,
we compile the program down to LLVM IR and then run a pass which instruments
each load and store instruction with a call into the Thrille framework.

The directory $THRILLE_ROOT/src/thrille-core/ contains the essential
components of Thrille.  The implementations here are automatically generated
by the scripts found in $THRILLE_ROOT/scripts/config/, and have several
functions:

    - Getting pointers to the original pthread functions (originals.h,
    originals.cpp) 
    
    - Intercepting the pthread functions and providing hooks for Thrillers
    (libpth.h, libpth.cpp) 
        
    - Identifying threads at runtime (threadtracker.h, threadtracker.cpp) 
        
    - Implementing the shared portion of the Makefile for every Thriller
    (core.mk)
    
    - Implementing a dummy library which allows you to run binaries
    instrumented with LLVM without using a Thriller (dummy.cpp).


Originals: This class uses the C interface to the dynamic loader (dlsym) to
    get references to the original pthread functions.  This allows us to call
    original pthread functions from within Thrille instrumentation without
    being ambiguous as to whether we want to call the real function or the
    instrumented wrapper.  For example, inside a Thriller, I would write
    Originals::pthread_mutex_lock(my_mutex) to call the uninstrumented version
    of lock.

    -originals.cpp: line 127: here we actually use dlsym to get pointers to
    the original functions with a macro defined at the top of the file.

    -originals.cpp: line 246: here we actually implement the call the original
    function.  We check if it's null first (which can happen if we run a
    program which does not link in pthreads) and then we just forward the call
    to the private function pointer which we initialize on line 127.


Libpth: This class implements the Handler class, from which every Thriller
inherits.  This class has the interposition functions, and the default
implementations for the handle methods (e.g. BeforeMutexLock,
SimulateMutexLock, AfterMutexLock).  We'll look at pthread_mutex_lock to get a
feel for how the interposition code works: 

    -libpth.cpp: line 2577: this is the declaration of pthread_mutex_lock
    which actually "causes" the interposition.  This declaration is the exact
    same as the declaration of pthread_mutex_lock in the pthread header.
    Thus, when we preload this library, the linker will resolve any call to
    pthread_mutex_lock to this function (since preloaded libraries get checked
    first).  This function checks to see if we've initialized the Handler
    class yet and then gets the id of this function call by examining the
    stack (__builtin_return_address). It then calls the Handler's
    implementation of this function (in this case, thrille_mutex_lock).

    -libpth.cpp: line 144:  here is the implementation of thrille_mutex_lock
    called by the interposing function. thrille_mutex_lock is a private method
    and thus subclasses can't override it.  However, if you look at the code
    it calls three handles which can be overridden (BeforeMutexLock,
    SimulateMutexLock, and AfterMutexLock).  Note the return of
    BeforeMutexLock determines if the original function is called or  the
    SimulateMutexLock function is called.  Essentially, to write a
    Thriller, you subclass Handler and override the specific handles you are
    intereseted by (Before*, Simulate*, After*).

These are the essential pieces of the core.  To get a feel for how a Thriller
looks, I'd suggested taking a look at the basic race detection Thriller, racer.
The files $THRILLE_ROOT/src/racer/libracer.h and
$THRILLE_ROOT/src/racer/libracer.cpp would be good places to start.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Thrille Directory Structure
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In $THRILLE_ROOT, there are a number of folders:

benchmarks: Most of the benchmarks have seeded bugs in them (e.g. atomicity
violations in shared queue implementation, mis-initialized barriers, etc).
These bugs are put in by the preprocessor--if you grep for "ERR1" you can see
what these bugs actually look like in code.

    - $THRILLE_ROOT/benchmarks/simpl/ is the path to the benchmarks used for
    the trace simplification project (also includes benchmarks that are still a
    "work in progress").  Benchmarks bbuf, blackscholes, bzip2, canneal,
    ctrace, dedup, pbzip2, pfscan, streamcluster, swarm, and x264 should work
    with thrille.

    - $THRILLE_ROOT/benchmarks/simpl/common.mk contains the paths to setup
    LLVM.  Thrille comes with the binaries needed for this and they should work
    out of the box on potus (at least, they did when we installed it for
    Chang-Seo).

    - $THRILLE_ROOT/benchmarks/simpl/README has an example on how to run each
    benchmark as well as some details about them.  At a high level, in each
    benchmark directory (besides x264, which has a more complicated build
    process) there should be a Makefile with 4 targets: 
        - "make" builds with no instrumentation.
        - "make llvm" builds with memory instrumentation assuming llvm 
          is setup correctly.
        - "make llvmerr1" builds with the seeded error and memory 
          instrumentation.
        - "make clean" cleans the bin and obj directory.

bin: Where all the compiled Thrille libraries get placed.

doc: Record of bugs found in Thrille and a smaller README. 

test: Various support files for the Thrille test suite reside here.

scripts: contains support scripts as well as CHESS and Tinertia implementation.

    - $THRILLE_ROOT/scripts/config/* contain the scripts to automatically
      generate the Thrille core hooking implementation.

    - $THRILLE_ROOT/scripts/runfunctionaltests.py runs test scripts for 
      the various Thrillers.

    - $THRILLE_ROOT/scripts/create_new_project.py automatically generates a
      new, empty Thriller in $THRILLE_ROOT/src/

    - $THRILLE_ROOT/simpl/* contains several scripts to clean and compile the
      Thrille components needed for CHESS and Tinertia.

    - $THRILLE_ROOT/simpl/src/* contains the Tinertia and CHESS python
      implementations.  At a high level, these scripts execute a benchmark
      under a Thriller, read in the resulting trace, do some processing (e.g.
      generating a search stack or applying a simplifying operation), and
      output a new trace to be executed. common/schedule.py contains the
      "trace" abstraction.  chess/chess.py and chess/searchstack.py make up the
      CHESS implementation. tinertia/tinertia.py is the Tinertia
      implementation.


src:

    - $THRILLE_ROOT/src/thrille-core/ contains the autogenerated files that are
    the basis for every Thriller.  This folder includes functionalities such
    as: 1) Get pointers to the original pthread functions (originals.h,
    originals.cpp), 2) intercepting the pthread functions and providing hooks
    for Thrillers (libpth.h, libpth.cpp), 3) Identifying threads at runtime
    (threadtracker.h, threadtracker.cpp), 4) The shared portion of the
    Makefile for every Thriller (core.mk), and 5) the dummy library
    which allows you to run binaries instrumented with LLVM without using a
    Thriller (dummy.cpp).

    - $THRILLE_ROOT/src/racer/ is a fairly straightforward implementation of
    hybrid race detection.

    - $THRILLE_ROOT/src/lockrace/ is an extension of racer that considers
    lock contentions.

    - $THRILLE_ROOT/src/serializer/ is the record and replay Thriller that
    serializes executions and tracks which threads are enabled. Tinertia and
    CHESS are both built on extensions of this Thriller.

    - $THRILLE_ROOT/src/randomschedule/ is an extension of serializer that does
    basic randomized scheduling.

    - $THRILLE_ROOT/src/randact/ is an extension of randomschedule that does
    active testing of lock and data races.

    - $THRILLE_ROOT/src/relaxedserial and $THRILLE_ROOT/src/addrserial are the
    Thrillers that implement the variety of trace replay relaxation techniques
    which we used in Tinertia.

    - $THRILLE_ROOT/src/chessserial is a Thriller that does basic
    non-preemptive fair scheduling used for the CHESS implementation.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Simplification Example
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that $THRILLE_ROOT/doc/UbuLLVM contains a more advanced simplification
example.

At a high level, here is how simplification works: 

-You build a program with the LLVM tools using the loadstore pass to
instrument memory (in benchmarks/simpl, each program has a Makefile which does
this automatically once you get LLVM and the environment set up) 

-You run the program under the liblockrace.so thriller, this produces a file
"thrille-randomactive" with a record of the races discovered.  

-You run the program under the librandact.so thriller, this reads a race pair
from the "thrille-randomactive" file and performs random active testing on it.
This will potentially hit a bug.  When it does find a bug, the buggy execution
trace will be found in "my-schedule" file in the directory you ran active
testing.  

-You then call the script scripts/simpl/src/tinertia/tinertia.py [start trace]
[end trace] [program binary] [program flag] which automatically runs the
simplification and outputs the simplified trace into [end trace].  Replay the
end trace by copying it to thrille-relaxed-sched and using librelaxedserial.so.

And now a walk through.  

1) This is on potus and I have just done the basic setup at the top of this
file.

jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952> echo $THRILLE_ROOT
/home/jalbert/newthrille/thrille-2952
jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952> echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
/home/jalbert/newthrille/thrille-2952/bin/
jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952> ls
benchmarks  bin  doc  README  scripts  src  tests


2) Now we will clean the Thrille installation and compile the Thrillers
pertinents to CHESS and Tinertia:

jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952> cd scripts/simpl/
jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952/scripts/simpl> ./clean.sh
jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952/scripts/simpl> ./compile.sh

3) This will compile the pertinent thrillers.  Wait until this completes!  I
have provided a contrived test example which segfaults on specific thread
interleavings in $THRILLE_ROOT/benchmarks/simple-test.cpp.  First thing we want
to do is compile this (we won't use LLVM as that will complicate this process,
see the simpl benchmark makefiles for examples on how to use LLVM).  Run it a
few times and it probably won't segfault:

jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952/scripts/simpl> cd /home/jalbert/newthrille/thrille-2952/benchmarks/
jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952/benchmarks> g++ -g -lpthread -o simple-test -g simple-test.cpp
jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952/benchmarks> ./simple-test
X is 3

4) We will now run the lock contention and race detector:

jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952/benchmarks> LD_PRELOAD=../bin/liblockrace.so ./simple-test
Thrille:Starting Default thriller...
Starting Race detection...
Write profiling size is 5
Read profiling size is 5
Starting Lockrace Thriller...
Using modified hybrid tracker
X is 3
Ending Lockrace Thriller...
Races:
Race: LockRaceRecord(0x400a0a, 0x400a42)
Race: LockRaceRecord(0x4009d2, 0x400a42)
Race: LockRaceRecord(0x40099a, 0x400a42)
Race: LockRaceRecord(0x4009d2, 0x400a0a)
Race: LockRaceRecord(0x40099a, 0x400a0a)
Race: LockRaceRecord(0x40099a, 0x4009d2)

Data Race Events: 0

Lock Race Events: 25
Ending Race detection...
Thrille:Ending Default thriller...

5) Notice we got lock race events but not data race events (because we did not
compile with LLVM).  The lock race library will output the found races in the
file thrille-randomactive in the directory in which you ran it.

jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952/benchmarks> ls
simpl  simple-test  simple-test.cpp  thrille-randomactive

6) Now we run the random active testing library to see if we can get it to
segfault.  This might take a while because the interleaving is pretty specific
to get the segfault (i.e. the first created thread has to execute its critical section last).  After
about 20 tries I finally witnessed a buggy run:

jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952/benchmarks> LD_PRELOAD=../bin/librandact.so ./simple-test
Thrille:Starting Default thriller...
Thrille:Starting Serializer Thriller...
Starting Random Active Testing...
Schedule Hash ID: 0
Thrille: Randomscheduler now defaults to scheduling at *EVERY* memory access
Thrille: Chance of preemption set at 1/1
NOTE: Random Active now defaults to scheduling at NO memory access points,
if no data races are found in thrille-randomactive
Random Active (Lock) Testing started...
Target 1: 0x40099a, Target 2: 0x400a42
SEGFAULT by thread 0
Number of Context Switches: 14
Number of Preemptions: 8
Number of Non-Preemptive Context Switches: 6


7) There will now be a file, my-schedule, which has the trace of the buggy
execution:

jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952/benchmarks> ls
my-schedule  simpl  simple-test  simple-test.cpp  thrille-randomactive

8) You can replay this file by copying it to the "thrille-sched" file and using
the strict serializer:

jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952/benchmarks> cp my-schedule thrille-sched
jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952/benchmarks> LD_PRELOAD=../bin/libstrictserial.so ./simple-test
Thrille:Starting Default thriller...
Thrille:Starting Serializer Thriller...
Starting *strict* serializer handler...
Schedule Hash ID: 7720116363682796622
SEGFAULT by thread 0
Number of Context Switches: 14
Number of Preemptions: 9
Number of Non-Preemptive Context Switches: 5

9) Note the number of preemptions and non-preemptions might change between the
report of the random active tester and the replay--this is expected.  The total
context switches should remain the same and the preemptions and non-preemptions
in the replay should be constant no matter how many times you replay.  Now we
are ready for simplification.  Move the buggy trace to somewhere that won't get
overwritten and then invoke the simplification script (note, if you execute
this script with no arguments it will give you a usage message):


jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952/benchmarks> mv thrille-sched simplify-start
jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952/benchmarks> python /home/jalbert/newthrille/thrille-2952/scripts/simpl/src/tinertia/tinertia.py simplify-start simplify-end simple-test

10) simplify-end now contains the simplified schedule.  We can replay the
simplified buggy trace by copying it to thrille-relaxed-sched (the script outputs
the trace in a different format than the input) and using the relaxed testing
thriller:

jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952/benchmarks> cp simplify-end thrille-relaxed-sched
jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952/benchmarks> LD_PRELOAD=../bin/librelaxedtester.so ./simple-test

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) CHESS Example
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This jumps off where the last walk through ended.  We can also use CHESS to
check our program as follows:

1) Remove all the simplification traces:

jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952/benchmarks> rm my-schedule simplify-end simplify-start thrille-randomactive thrille-relaxed-sched

2) Use the chess python script as follows (note, if you execute this script
with no arguments it will give you a usage message).  Here we made a
directory for any buggy traces CHESS finds and then CHESS check with a
preemption bound of 0.  We find the segfault after 44 executions and then
CHESS terminates (we could also continue CHESS search if we desired):

jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952/benchmarks> mkdir chess_schedules
jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952/benchmarks> python /home/jalbert/newthrille/thrille-2952/scripts/simpl/src/chess/chess.py 0 none chess_schedules simple-test

at 44 executions

        Found Errors:
                thread 0 segfault in 44 iterations.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) Making your own Thriller Example
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, making a new Thriller is very easy.  Again, this assumes you've done
the basic setup at the top of this file.

1) The script $THRILLE_ROOT/scripts/create_new_project.py will automatically
set up the directory for you.  We will make a Thriller called emptythriller:

jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952/scripts> cd /home/jalbert/newthrille/thrille-2952/scripts/
jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952/scripts> python create_new_project.py emptythriller
Makefile done...
Library header done...
Library body done...
Create handler done...
Custom function interposition done
Unit test done...

2) We can now check out our new thriller by going into the source directory.
   This will contain a skeleton Thriller which will compile.  You can start
   overriding pthread method handles (e.g. BeforeMutexLock) if you would like.
   We will just compile and run the empty Thriller.

jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952/scripts> cd /home/jalbert/newthrille/thrille-2952/src/emptythriller/
jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952/src/emptythriller> make

3) Wait for make to complete and you can then use the empty thriller:

jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952/benchmarks> cd /home/jalbert/newthrille/thrille-2952/benchmarks/
jalbert@potus:~/newthrille/thrille-2952/benchmarks> LD_PRELOAD=../bin/libemptythriller.so ./simple-test
Thrille:Starting Default thriller...
Starting Emptythriller Thriller...
X is 3
Ending Emptythriller Thriller...
Thrille:Ending Default thriller...

4) Check out other Thrillers to get a feel for how to do the method overriding.
   The racer Thriller is probably a good one to start looking at.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7) FAQ
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) How do I map a schedule back to source code?

Thrille uses the GCC function __builtin_return_address(0) to statically
identify memory and synchronization events.  Looking in a schedule file (in
this example my-schedule generated by running a schedule fuzzer on the VIPS
benchmark), the schedule will be specified by the following format:

SCHED
chosen:0
caller:0
typstr:After_Mutex_Unlock
idaddr:0x438612
enable:0,

The idaddr it the identifier of the statement that generated this event.  To
map it to source, use the binutil addr2line (note: your binary must have been
compiled with debugging information for this to work).  e.g.:

jalbert@potus:~/thrille/benchmarks/simpl/vips/bin> addr2line -e vips 0x438612
/thrille/benchmarks/simpl/vips/src/vips-7.20.0/libvips/iofuncs/init.c:185

This identification scheme can fail when a dynamically loaded library uses
non-trivial threading (because the library will be mapped to different parts
of a program's memory in different executions)--try statically linking the
offending library.  Also, the script
$THRILLE_ROOT/scripts/simpl/generateScheduleInfo.py will automatically perform
the binutil call on every address in a schedule--execute the script with no
arguments to get usage information.


2) How do I change what functions Thrille wraps?

The implementation in $THRILLE_ROOT/src/thrille-core/ determines which
function calls Thrille will intercept.  The script
$THRILLE_ROOT/scripts/config/corecodegen.py will automatically regenerate the
Thrille core classes.  

The marshalled python dictionary found at
$THRILLE_ROOT/scripts/config/pthreaddict contains the function signatures of
each function used by the corecodegen.py script to determine which functions
it should intercept. The dictionary format is:

 "function name":["return type", "arg 1 type", "arg 2 type", ..., "arg n type"]

To modify which function calls Thrille intercepts, one can unmarshal the
dictionary in python, add or delete the functions in question, write the
dictionary back out, execute the corecodegen.py script, and then recompile.

3) How do I turn on debug information for serializer based Thrillers?

Thrille reads the file found a
$THRILLE_ROOT/src/serializer/config/thrille-print to determine if it should
print debug info to standard out while executing.  A 1 in the file will turn
debug info on, a 0 in this file will turn debug info off.
