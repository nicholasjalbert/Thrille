-fwdback algorithm = sometimes we can save preemptions by not treating the last schedule point as

0
0
0
0
1
1
0
0

-edit the create project script to handle build dependencies and auto generate
the Makefile

-__libc_start_main is called directly before main starts--can be used to filter
out synchronization events that result from library initialization
