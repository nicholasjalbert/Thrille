Thrille: Thread Interposition Library and Lightweight Extensions

Thrille expects the environment variable THRILLE_ROOT to be defined as the path
to the thrille folder where you found this readme (e.g. if I checked out the
whole Thrille project to my home directory the following command could be
executed or put into my .bashrc to make scripts execute as expected: "export
THRILLE_ROOT=~/thrille/trunk/thrille").

A binary of the LLVM pass which instruments memory reads and writes has been
provided in the bin directory.  The src can be found in src/LoadStore/
directory.  To modify or change, checkout the current version of LLVM from
their svn (currently 'svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk llvm')
and move the LoadStore folder into the llvm/lib/Transforms/ directory and then
edit/call make from there.
